create main file that executes everything
figure out jpanel and jframe updating and png/jpeg drawing
make game loop in main file
functions for initializing window, then game loop function

keep animations minimal to make this easier

map object class, one map for every level, randomly genrated platform lengths, but similar amounts of platforms on each map, exit on random platform
array of platform objects, contain position of platform, 

gravity can be made easily, reduce y position if not on ground, do momentum system, moving left/right = momentum+=x;, position += momentum, momentum = 0 at stop, y momentum -= when in air.

player object class, player can shoot pellet in direction they are moving to kill enemy, stores position, health, score
coin object class, coin make sound when picked up, update score and disapear when picked up, if picked_up, not visible and wont add points
enemy object class, 3 size of enemies, walk back and forth randomly along their platform
random length platforms? will be created on launch, store platform edges 

game_loop(){
    checkPlayerInput()
    applyInput()//move player, shoot pellet, make sure player not off map, etc
    checkActions()//hit by enemy, on coin, on level exit
    applyActions() change hp, change score, go onto next level, etc
}


step1: create screen X
step2: create class files for seperate entities X
step3: draw things onto screen at specific pixel locations X
step4: move said things on a tick intervalmX
step5: influence movemnt with keyboard input X
step6: implement basic character movemnt rules X
step7: implemnt boundaries and platforms X
step 7.5(moved): make drawing of platforms X
step 7.75: make platform spacing rules to make them proper X
step 7.8: make platform landing functional X
step8: create enemies that pace around on platforms 
step8.5: make enemy jump on platform by checking proxmity to each platform
step9: create coins X
step10: make coins collectable X
step11: make score display X
step12: make character shoot X
step13: make enemies deadable X
step14: gain score for eliminating enemies X
step15: make exit door X
step16: make moving platforms
step17: make entry sceen gamestate X
step18: make win screen gamestate
step19: add sound effects  X
step20: add mutliple levels X
step20.5: make proper sprites X
step 20.75: make animations X
step21: add cool obstacles (fire, water, lava, etc.)
step22: add powerups (double jump, faster shooting, extra life, stronger shooting)

Currently working on:
add remaining levels
and more complexity to levels
